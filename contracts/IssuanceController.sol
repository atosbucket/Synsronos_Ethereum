MODULE DESCRIPTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Issuance controller contract. The issuance controller provides
a way for users to acquire nomins (Nomin.sol) and havvens
(Havven.sol) by paying ETH and a way for users to acquire havvens
(Havven.sol) by paying nomins. Users can also deposit their nomins
and allow other users to purchase them with ETH. The ETH is sent
to the user who offered their nomins for sale.

This smart contract contains a balance of each currency, and
allows the owner of the contract (the Havven Foundation) to
manage the available balance of havven at their discretion, while
users are allowed to deposit and withdraw their own nomin deposits
if they have not yet been taken up by another user.
