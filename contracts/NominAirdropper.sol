MODULE DESCRIPTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This contract was adapted for use by the Havven project from the
airdropper contract that OmiseGO created here:
https://github.com/omisego/airdrop/blob/master/contracts/Airdropper.sol

It exists to save gas costs per transaction that'd otherwise be
incurred running airdrops individually.
