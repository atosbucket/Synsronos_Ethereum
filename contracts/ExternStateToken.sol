MODULE DESCRIPTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------

A partial ERC20 token contract, designed to operate with a proxy.
To produce a complete ERC20 token, transfer and transferFrom
tokens must be implemented, using the provided _byProxy internal
functions.
This contract utilises an external state for upgradeability.

        If we're transferring to a contract and it implements the havvenTokenFallback function, call it.
        This isn't ERC223 compliant because:
           1. We don't revert if the contract doesn't implement havvenTokenFallback.
              This is because many DEXes and other contracts that expect to work with the standard
              approve / transferFrom workflow don't implement tokenFallback but can still process our tokens as
              usual, so it feels very harsh and likely to cause trouble if we add this restriction after having
              previously gone live with a vanilla ERC20.
           2. We don't pass the bytes parameter.
              This is because of this solidity bug: https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/2884
           3. We also don't let the user use a custom tokenFallback. We figure as we're already not standards
              compliant, there won't be a use case where users can't just implement our specific function.

        As such we've called the function havvenTokenFallback to be clear that we are not following the standard.
